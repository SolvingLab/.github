## About

SolvingLab is a bioinformatics research organization dedicated to developing computational methodologies and software tools for multi-omics data analysis. Our research focuses on integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to address fundamental questions in cancer biology, immunology, and precision medicine.

### Research Areas

**Cancer Genomics & Multi-Omics Integration**  
Development of computational frameworks for analyzing large-scale cancer genomic datasets, including TCGA and CPTAC. Our tools enable comprehensive characterization of tumor molecular profiles and identification of clinically relevant biomarkers.

**Computational Immunology**  
Algorithmic approaches for tumor microenvironment deconvolution, immune cell infiltration quantification, and immune checkpoint therapy response prediction.

**Systems Biology & Network Analysis**  
Integration of molecular interaction networks with functional genomics data to understand biological systems and disease mechanisms.

**AI-Driven Biological Discovery**  
Application of large language models and machine learning approaches to automate and enhance biological data interpretation and hypothesis generation.
